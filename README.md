A ruby client for the [Airbrake API](http://help.airbrake.io/kb/api-2/api-overview)

## Changes in 4.0

AirbrakeAPI has been completely rewritten in 4.0.  Why the high version number?
This was the first gem I ever wrote and it's wandered a path that started with
ActiveResource, followed by HTTParty, and now Faraday.  Along the way, AirbrakeAPI
has lost it's ActiveRecord-like syntax for a more concise and simple API.  Instead
of using classes such as `AirbrakeAPI::Error`, the entire API is contained within
`AirbrakeAPI::Client`.

The following classes and their methods are now deprecated:

* `AirbrakeAPI::Error`
* `AirbrakeAPI::Notice`
* `AirbrakeAPI::Project`

While your code will continue to work using the old API, they will ultimately be removed in favor of `AirbrakeAPI::Client`.

## Configuration

AirbrakeAPI can be configured by passing a hash to the configure method:

    AirbrakeAPI.configure(:account => 'anapp', :auth_token => 'abcdefg', :secure => true)

or via a block:

    AirbrakeAPI.configure do |config|
      config.account = 'anapp'
      config.auth_token = 'abcdefg'
      config.secure = true
    end

**Note:**  Airbrake's API utilizes a separate 'auth_token' than the API Key that is used to configure the Airbrake tracker.  Your 'auth_token' is found on the bottom of the user settings page.

## Finding Errors

Errors are paginated, the API responds with 25 at a time, pass an optional params hash for additional pages:

    AirbrakeAPI.errors
    AirbrakeAPI.errors(:page => 2)

To find an individual error, you can find by ID:

    AirbrakeAPI.error(error_id)


## Finding Notices

Find *all* notices of an error:

    AirbrakeAPI.notices(error_id)

Notices may be paginated.  If you don't want to retrieve all notices and merely want a specific page:

    AirbrakeAPI.notices(error_id, :page => 3)

Find an individual notice:

    AirbrakeAPI.notice(notice_id, error_id)

To resolve an error via the API:

    AirbrakeAPI.update(1696170, :group => { :resolved => true})

Recreate an error:

    STDOUT.sync = true
    AirbrakeAPI.notices(error_id) do |batch|
      batch.each do |notice|
        result = system "curl --silent '#{notice.request.url}' > /dev/null"
        print (result ? '.' : 'F')
      end
    end

## Projects

To retrieve a list of projects:

    AirbrakeAPI.projects

## Deployments

To retrieve a list of deployments:

    AirbrakeAPI.deploys(project_id)

## Connecting to more than one account

While module-based configuration will work in most cases, if you'd like to simultaneously connect to more than one account at once, you can create instances of `AirbrakeAPI::Client` to do so:

    client = AirbrakeAPI::Client.new(:account => 'myaccount', :auth_token => 'abcdefg', :secure => true)
    altclient = AirbrakeAPI::Client.new(:account => 'anotheraccount', :auth_token => '123456789', :secure => false)

    client.errors

    altclient.projects

## Responses

If an error is returned from the API, an AirbrakeError exception will be raised.  Successful responses will return a Hashie::Mash object based on the data from the response.
